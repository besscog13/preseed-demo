# Backend Stub Analysis

## Overview
The provided `main.py` file defines a FastAPI application named "RCRA Policy & Audit Stub (+metrics/drift/score)" (version 0.4.0). The service focuses on exposing configuration-driven policy data, telemetry metrics, and a pricing example tied to YAML-based policy files.

## Policy Management
* Policy profiles are loaded from `/home/oai/share/slrc.yaml`, and LPD pricing configuration is loaded from `/home/oai/share/lpd.yaml`. Missing or unreadable files safely resolve to empty dictionaries.
* SLRC profiles are parsed into `SLRCProfile` Pydantic models, and exported back to dictionaries for API responses. A Blake2b hash is calculated to track policy versions.
* `/v1/policy/slrc` returns either all profiles or a specific profile with configuration details and both per-profile and global hashes. `/v1/policy/coverage` exposes weight vectors and coverage minimums for a given or default profile.

## Metrics Endpoint
* `/metrics` streams plain-text Prometheus-style metrics. Values are randomly perturbed demo data around realistic-looking baselines (`rcra_valuescore`, `rcra_lpd`, `rcra_g_mean`, etc.), suggesting where live telemetry hooks would integrate.

## Pricing Example
* `/v1/pricing/quote` demonstrates Decimal-based pricing derived from the LPD YAML. It selects the best uplift tier based on the request's `lpd` value, applies the uplift to the base price, rounds with `qmoney`, and returns the chosen tier and policy hash. The `tokens` argument is a placeholder for integrating real usage drivers.

## Business & Demo Alignment
* **Configuration-driven governance** – By sourcing policies from share-mounted YAML, the service supports rapid iteration of regulatory or risk configurations without code changes.
* **Auditability** – Version hashes offer lightweight provenance for profiles and pricing policy, aiding audits and change management.
* **Telemetry integration path** – The metrics endpoint demonstrates how operational KPIs could be surfaced; swapping the random jitter for real monitoring values would enable production observability.
* **Pricing sandbox** – The quote endpoint illustrates how cost models could leverage policy data and precise monetary arithmetic, providing a foundation for experimenting with pricing strategies before full integration.

## Next Steps
* Replace the demo random data in `/metrics` with actual business telemetry feeds.
* Harden file loading by validating existence or introducing a configuration layer rather than relying on fixed share paths.
* Expand pricing logic to incorporate usage drivers (e.g., `tokens`) and scenario analyses aligned with business KPIs.
* Add authentication/authorization if policy or pricing data requires access control.
